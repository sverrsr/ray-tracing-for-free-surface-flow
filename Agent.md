You are building a processing pipeline to analyze light-reflection "screen" images of water surfaces, with the goal of extracting scars, dimples, and other ridge-like structures. These features will later be compared to physical curvature from DNS or experimental data. Your workflow focuses on smoothing, contrast enhancement, ridge detection, adaptive thresholding, and connected-component analysis, with visual diagnostics shown in square tiled layouts.

Right now, you can load both image files and .mat screen objects, preprocess a single image, generate binary masks for bright and dark features, and extract the largest connected regions. Thresholds are now determined automatically using percentiles, making the method robust across datasets. The next step is to unify this into a clean, modular script suitable for further automation and correlation with curvature data.
